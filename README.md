# Program

I am glad to share that we have completed our third Probation task of the Software Development team of RAC - Robotics and Automation Club. My team ( Hariharan J and Nithyashree V K) and I were given the Problem Statement to write a Python Script to display time and to set Alarm, Reminder and Counter Timer. From this task, I have learnt how to build a GUI window using tkinter module in Python.


The modules we imported are:

plyer, tkinter, datetime, winsound
